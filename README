## Setup

1. Clone or download this repository.

2. Open `main.py` and update the paths at the top of `main()`:


disable_open_tablet_driver_path = r"C:\path\to\DisableWacomDrivers.bat"
open_tablet_driver_path = r"C:\path\to\OpenTabletDriver.UX.Wpf.exe"
osu_path = r"C:\path\to\osu!.exe"

## Tip: Turn it into a one-click executable

After you’ve updated the paths in `main.py` and confirmed the script works:

1. You can turn the script into a standalone `.exe` using **PyInstaller**:
   py -m PyInstaller --onefile --noconsole --uac-admin main.py
